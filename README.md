# Olive Video Editor Community Edition

[![Build status](https://github.com/OliveCommunity/olive/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/OliveCommunity/olive/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)

Olive is a free non-linear video editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Unfortunately, the original author has not submitted code updates for over 7 months, and no public contact information (email or otherwise) is available to reach them directly and now we are maintaining a community edition for this project.

This project could now be successfully built with ffmpeg 7. I'm working for a plugin system for it.

**NOTE: Olive is alpha software and is considered highly unstable. While we highly appreciate users testing and providing usage information, please use at your own risk.**

## Current Status

I am working on the plugin branch to add OpenFX plugins support. After that I'll try to fix the issues which was submitted on the origin project.

## Binaries
The original author compiled following binaries:
- [0.1.0 alpha](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive/releases/tag/0.1.0)
- [0.2.0 unstable development build](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive/releases/tag/0.2.0-nightly)
